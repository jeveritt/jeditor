/**
 * This package contains the runnable program jedit.
 * <br>
 * This is my first try at GitHub. It is a simple text editor written in Java using Swing.
 * My main motivation is to get familiar with how GitHub Java projects are organized,
 * although the jedit program itself may be of interest to some.
