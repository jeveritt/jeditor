/**
 * This package contains the runnable program jedit.
 * <p>
 * This is my first try at GitHub. It is a simple text editor written in Java using Swing.
 * My main motivation is to get familiar with how GitHub Java projects are organized,
 * although the jedit program itself may be of interest to some.
 * <p>
 * The text editor stuff is contained in my_proj.my_lib.lib_swing_editor with supporting
 * stuff in other libraries under my_proj.my_lib.
 * <p>
 * The my_proj.my_lib.lib_swing_editor directory contains 3 top level classes.
 * <pre>
 *   SwingMyEditorJFrame         -> The editor sitting inside a JFrame for stand alone use
 *   SwingMyEditorJInternalFrame -> The editor sitting inside a JInternalFrame for use inside
 *                                  a JFrame of another project
 *   SwingMyEditorJDialog        -> The editor sitting inside a JDialog for use as a dialog
 *                               -> inside another project
 * </pre>
